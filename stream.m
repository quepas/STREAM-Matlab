%  3. You are free to publish results obtained from running this

%     with the following limitations:
%     3a. In order to be referred to as "STREAM benchmark results",
%         published results must be in conformance to the STREAM
%         Run Rules, (briefly reviewed below) published at
%         http://www.cs.virginia.edu/stream/ref.html
%         and incorporated herein by reference.
%         As the copyright holder, John McCalpin retains the
%         right to determine conformity with the Run Rules.
%     3b. Results based on modified source code or on runs not in
%         accordance with the STREAM Run Rules must be clearly
%         labelled whenever they are published.  Examples of
%         proper labelling include:
%         "tuned STREAM benchmark results"
%         "based on a variant of the STREAM benchmark code"
%         Other comparable, clear and reasonable labelling is
%         acceptable.
%     3c. Submission of results to the STREAM benchmark web site
%         is encouraged, but not required.
%  4. Use of this program or creation of derived works based on this
%     program constitutes acceptance of these licensing restrictions.
%  5. Absolutely no warranty is expressed or implied.

% This program measures sustained memory transfer rates in MB/s for
% simple computational kernels coded in MATLAB.
%
% The intent is to demonstrate the extent to which ordinary user
% code can exploit the main memory bandwidth of the system under
% test.
%=======================================================================
% The STREAM web page is at:
%          http://www.cs.virginia.edu/stream/
%
% BRIEF INSTRUCTIONS:
%       0) See http://www.cs.virginia.edu/stream/ref.html for details
%       1) STREAM requires a timing function called mysecond().
%          Several examples are provided in this directory.
%          "CPU" timers are only allowed for uniprocessor runs.
%          "Wall-clock" timers are required for all multiprocessor runs.
%       2) The STREAM array sizes must be set to size the test.
%          The value "N" must be chosen so that each of the three
%          arrays is at least 4x larger than the sum of all the last-
%          level caches used in the run, or 1 million elements, which-
%          ever is larger.
%          ------------------------------------------------------------
%          Note that you are free to use any array length and offset
%          that makes each array 4x larger than the last-level cache.
%          The intent is to determine the %best% sustainable bandwidth
%          available with this simple coding.  Of course, lower values
%          are usually fairly easy to obtain on cached machines, but
%          by keeping the test to the %best% results, the answers are
%          easier to interpret.
%          You may put the arrays in common or not, at your discretion.
%          There is a commented-out COMMON statement below.
%          Fortran90 "allocatable" arrays are fine, too.
%          ------------------------------------------------------------
%       3) Compile the code with full optimization.  Many compilers
%          generate unreasonably bad code before the optimizer tightens
%          things up.  If the results are unreasonably good, on the
%          other hand, the optimizer might be too smart for me
%          Please let me know if this happens.
%       4) Mail the results to mccalpin@cs.virginia.edu
%          Be sure to include:
%               a) computer hardware model number and software revision
%               b) the compiler flags
%               c) all of the output from the test case.
%          Please let me know if you do not want your name posted along
%          with the submitted results.
%       5) See the web page for more comments about the run rules and
%          about interpretation of the results.

% Thanks,
%   Dr. Bandwidth
